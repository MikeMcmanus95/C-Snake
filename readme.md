# Simple Snake Game in C++
Created by Michael Mcmanus on 5/15/2018.
NOTE: Run using Microsoft Visual Studio

This is a C++ rendition of the popular and addictive game Snake. Use the W,A,S and D keys to move
your snake around the map, try to collect the fruits (indicated by $) and watch your snakes tail grow!
But be careful not to eat yourself once the snake grows long enough! The X key terminates the game.
